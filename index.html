      <h3>Health Insurance</h3>
      <p>Health insurance is essentially a financial safety net that protects you from the burden of medical expenses. You pay a regular fee called a premium, and in return the insurance company helps cover costs for hospitalization, surgeries, medicines, and preventive care. Often, you’ll need to pay a deductible before the insurer starts contributing, and even then you may share costs through copayments or coinsurance. The benefits include financial protection, access to quality care, preventive services, tax savings, and peace of mind. However, there are limitations like exclusions, waiting periods, rising premiums, restrictions to certain hospitals, and possible claim rejections. Choosing the right plan means considering whether you need coverage for yourself or your family, how much premium fits your budget, whether cashless treatment matters, if you want critical illness protection, and how much coverage is enough for healthcare costs in your city.

      <h3>Life Insurance</h3>
      <p>Life is a journey that blends experiences, challenges, and growth into one continuous flow. It begins with curiosity and learning, where we discover the world around us and build relationships that shape who we are. As we move forward, life becomes a balance of responsibilities and dreams — working, studying, caring for family, and striving for personal goals. Along the way, there are moments of joy, love, and success that give us meaning, as well as struggles, setbacks, and losses that teach resilience and patience. Life is not just about reaching milestones but about the everyday choices we make, the values we hold, and the impact we leave on others. It is unpredictable, sometimes difficult, but always evolving, offering opportunities to grow, adapt, and find purpose in both the small details and the big picture.

    <h3>Health Insurance</h3>
    <p>
     Health insurance is essentially a financial safety net that protects you from the burden of medical expenses. You pay a regular fee called a premium, and in return the insurance company helps cover costs for hospitalization, surgeries, medicines, and preventive care. Often, you’ll need to pay a deductible before the insurer starts contributing, and even then you may share costs through copayments or coinsurance. Many insurers partner with network hospitals where you can receive cashless treatment, and when you face medical expenses you file a claim so the insurer either reimburses you or pays directly. There are different types of plans such as individual, family floater, group insurance, critical illness, top-up, and government schemes. The benefits include financial protection, access to quality care, preventive services, tax savings, and peace of mind. However, there are limitations like exclusions, waiting periods, rising premiums, restrictions to certain hospitals, and possible claim rejections. Choosing the right plan means considering whether you need coverage for yourself or your family, how much premium fits your budget, whether cashless treatment matters, if you want critical illness protection, and how much coverage is enough for healthcare costs in your city.
